h1. Phonegap/Bootstrap/Stasis/HAML

h2. Intro

This is currently a personal project. The aim is to automate the build of a Phonegap www directory from a more dynamic ruby source. Included libraries are: Twitter bootsrap, jQuery, jqTouch, backbone.js. Stylesheets are rendered with compass/sass, and layouts with HAML. Stasis provides a build mechanism to pull everything together into a single html file and stylesheet.
